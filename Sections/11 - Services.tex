  Merchandise pre-orders and event tickets are characterized by not
  requiring any physical merchandise to be kept in the Drain.

  \begin{enumerate}

    event tickets through the Drain must send the Drain Coordinator(s) a
    detailed email describing the merchandise/event, pricing, number to
    be sold, and a link to a google form for customers to fill out (if
    necessary). This email must be sent a minimum of 2 weeks before
    sales begin.

    The Drain will then sell said merchandise pre-order or event ticket
    for a maximum of 2 weeks unless specific permission is granted by
    the Drain Coordinator(s).

    The Drain is not responsible for the distribution of the pre-ordered
    merchandise once it arrives.
   \item
    Revenue shall be reimbursed by the VPF no more than one month after

    as all regular merchandise.
   \item
    Revenue shall be reimbursed by the VPF semi-annually until there are
    no more items remaining.
  \end{enumerate}
 \item
  Large merchandise is characterized by requiring a significant amount
  of storage/display space. This includes shirts, hoodies, hats, and
  other such merchandise.

  \begin{enumerate}
   \item
    Large merchandise will generally not be taken due to lack of storage
    and display space.
   \item
    Exceptions may be made for more ``general'' engineering merchandise
    - merchandise which is not specific to one single student
    organization. This is at the discretion of the Drain Coordinator(s)
    and VPF.
   \item
    If an exception is granted, the merchandise must be processed in the
    same fashion as small merchandise.

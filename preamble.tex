\hfill {\Huge \textbf{Bylaws}}

\vspace*{25pt}

\section*{Preamble}

These Bylaws were developed in 2020 in an effort to solidify the
activities and policies of the McMaster Engineering Society (MES),
separate from the Policy Manual. The policies documented here are
intended to accompany the Constitution and Policy Manual of the McMaster
Engineering Society and are binding terms of reference.

This Bylaw Document will assist in the transition of the MES from year
to year, and will also clarify the fundamental operations of the
Society. This document is meant to serve as a guide for everyday
operations, but is also intended to be a more flexible document than the
Constitution, but less so than the Policy Manual. The procedures for
amending this document are set out in the Constitution.

Overall this document will help the MES to operate more effectively and
efficiently in its effort to represent and serve the undergraduate
engineering student body at McMaster.

If a contradiction occurs between the Bylaws and the Constitution, the
Constitution will take precedence.
